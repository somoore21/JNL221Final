		<p>Every 10 years, congressional districts in the United States are redrawn according to the results of the most recent census. Following the collection of data from the 2020 Census, congressional districts across the country have been redrawn and approved, with the results of those changes seen in the 2022 midterm elections. In New York, redistricting resulted in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/nyregion/new-york-census-congress.html">loss</a> of a district and a significant shift in the shape of districts across the state. Instead of 27 districts, the state now has 26. </p>

		<p>Syracuse was considerably impacted by this change, being redrawn from the 24th district into the 22nd. Consequently, the results of the midterm elections demonstrated the demographic change in the new district, making New York’s new 22nd district more contested than previously. </p>

		<p>Syracuse, N.Y. — For the past 10 years, New York’s 24th district included <a href="https://newyork.redistrictingandyou.org/?districtType=cd&propA=current_2012&propB=congress_specialmastercorrected_20220604&opacity=2&selected=-76.121,43.021#%26map=5.78/42.8/-76.225">parts</a> of Wayne, Cayuga, Oswego and Onondaga counties. The redrawn district now includes the full counties of Oneida, Madison and Onondaga, and a small portion of Oswego county. In both cases, Onondaga county has been the anchor of the district, providing the largest population and most voters by the numbers. </p>

		<p>The Congressional race between Republican candidate Brandon Williams and Democratic candidate Francis Conole was one to watch during the midterm elections, providing a litmus test for how the demographics of the district shifted. Representative John Katko, a moderate Republican, formerly served Onondaga county while it was part of the 24th district. </p>

		<p>Post-redistricting, Williams, a <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/cny/2022/11/what-issues-separate-francis-conole-brandon-williams-in-race-for-central-ny-house-seat.html">highly conservative</a> candidate and political <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/cny/2022/10/meet-brandon-williams-an-outsider-fights-for-central-ny-seat-in-congress.html">newcomer</a>, <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2022/08/brandon-williams-campaign-claims-upset-over-steve-wells-in-gop-primary-for-congress.html">unexpectedly</a> won his primary election, initially signaling a potential demographic shift in Central New York. Williams has previously supported Trump and maintains an anti-abortion stance, both highly polarizing positions on hot-button issues through the midterms.</p>

		<p>Williams won the election against Conole by 2629 votes, demonstrating how competitive the new district is. Despite Onondaga county providing a considerable pull for Democratic voters, the 22nd district stayed red, with a more conservative candidate representing the area than before. </p>

		</script>

		<p>Though there are more blue districts in the state of New York than red ones, the election of a highly conservative candidate in a contested district by such a slim margin points to a larger <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/09/2022-election-results-analysis-and-takeaways-00065878">ideological shift</a> occurring in New York and across the country.</p>

		<p>In New York, redistricting follows the guidelines set by former governor Andrew Cuomo’s  Independent Redistricting Commission, which was voted on and adopted in 2014. The 2020 Census was the first to be impacted by Cuomo’s commission. </p>

		<p>The commission, which intends “to achieve a fair and readily transparent process by which to redraw the lines of state legislative and congressional districts,” according to its <a href="https://www.nyirc.gov/about">website</a>, is still imperfectly partisan. The supermajority of New York’s state legislature, held by <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/what-went-wrong-new-yorks-redistricting">Democrats</a>, was able to modify and submit district maps that were struck down as <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/state/new-york/?cycle=2020&level=Congress&startdate=2022-02-03">partisan</a>, gerrymandered maps. </p>

		<p>Subsequently, New York’s congressional redistricting was done by a <a href="https://hselaw.com/news-and-information/legalcurrents/new-york-state-redistricting-what-s-happened-and-what-s-next/">special master</a> and approved by Steuben County Acting Supreme Court Justice <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/11/new-york-redistricting-bath-00031096">Patrick McAllister</a>, a Republican-leaning judge. McAllister selected the special master and approved the maps drawn thereafter, leading New York state to have more <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/what-went-wrong-new-yorks-redistricting">competitive</a> districts. </p>

		<p>Brenda Greenfield, a resident of Onondaga County for 23 years, said she sees Central New York as a moderate-Republican voting area, but Syracuse as a moderate-Democrat city. After redistricting, Greenfield said she doesn’t believe there is a drastic ideological shift occurring in the new district, but the Conole and Williams race is indicative of increased competition.</p>

		<p>“This seat has been traditionally held primarily by moderate republicans,” she said. “I think the close election results between Conole and Williams might indicate a number of traditional Republican voters are finding some of the hard right platforms of the current republican party difficult to support.”</p>

		<p>As Greenfield sees it, though, Syracuse tends to lean Democrat. By the numbers, Onondaga County’s voter base outnumbers the voter base of the other two counties in the district, but trails in <a href="https://www.wrvo.org/elections/2022-11-08/onondaga-county-sees-large-turnout-in-early-voting">voter turnout</a>. The imbalance between voter turnout in Onondaga County and the activity of the smaller counties of Oneida and Madison is why New York’s 22nd district is one of the state’s most competitive. </p>

		<p>Dustin Czarny, the Democratic Elections Commissioner for Onondaga County’s Board of Elections, said the city of Syracuse’s low voter turnout is partially to blame for the competitive nature of New York’s 22nd district. According to Czarny, Onondaga County has a higher-than-average voter turnout relative to other counties in the state — except for the city of Syracuse. </p>

		<p> Low turnout in Syracuse drags down the district as a place that could otherwise be a Democratic region, Czarny said. Paired with the “blood red” counties of Madison and Oneida, the mixture leads to a Congressional district that is overall stuck in gridlock when it comes to federal elections, and Czarny believes the counties grouped in the 22nd district shouldn’t be. </p> 

		<p>“While it gives overall the illusion of competitiveness, what you really have is two polarized sections inside of these districts that, in my opinion, probably were not supposed to be put together,” Czarny said. “It's not competitive because it’s competitive across the whole district, you're gonna be having one part of the district fight against each other, and they don't have common interests. That can be hard for any representative to represent well.”</p>

		</script>

		<p>Redistricting has heated Central New York politics, converting a mildly predictable district into a hotly contested one — all with the switch of a few counties. As political issues become more polarized, voter apathy may decrease as the power of the individual’s vote gains greater importance. </p>

		<p>For a long-time resident like Greenfield, casting her vote in a district that can fall to either party is highly important. Issues with redistricting and voter turnout extend past the boundaries of New York’s 22nd district and to the rest of the country as the moral and ideological battle for democracy continues in a highly polarized world — which, Czarny said, voters will see play out in the region over the next decade. </p>

		<p>“We're gonna see a district over the next 10 years that is constantly battling against itself to see which of their chosen candidates is going to come out,” he said. </p>
